# About a Burger
This is the main project of the course, which is a Web app using React to build a Burguer and send orders. Here we explore React ejected from create-react-app, using custom CSS modules.

## TechStack
* React
* Firebase

## Installation
Use your terminal to go to the project folder and run:
```
npm install
```
or 
```
yarn
```

## Running
As this app requires firebase you will need to create a firebase app and paste it in a file "configs.js" in the "/src" folder with the firebase app parameters.

After that you just need to run the app with:
```
npm start
```
or 
```
yarn start
```
