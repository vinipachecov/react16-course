# react16-course
This is my personal code for the React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 &amp; Redux) | Udemy


In this course Max (the Instructor) provides us a deep dive into react using and explaning (of course) the best practices with it, going from SPA to other patterns of Web Development. Later on the course Max helps with testing and using recent techs like Next for app deploying.

## Projects
During the course we build a few apps used to explain some of the capabilities of React and how to use other libraries like Axios with it.
The projects in this Repository are:

 * Burger Builder
 * Http
 * React suspense use case
 * Assignments
